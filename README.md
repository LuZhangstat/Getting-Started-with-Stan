# Happy Scientist Seminar: Getting-Started-with-Stan
<<<<<<< HEAD
This seminar will introduce Stan, a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. Attendees will learn how to use Stan by working through a data analysis of the "eight schools" problem. The seminar will cover the basics of Stan, including how to code and run models, as well as tips and best practices for working with the language. The seminar is designed to provide a hands-on, step-by-step introduction to using Stan for Bayesian data analysis.
